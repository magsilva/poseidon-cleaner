I use the PoseidonCE [1] (Community Edition) to develop the Wiki/RE [2]. To
compile the tools's manual, I export most of the diagrams from 
Poseidon, saving them as EPS files. However, the CE edition of Poseidon
adds an annoying label at the diagram's footer, along with a box all
over the diagram. And that doesn't look pretty. I already acknowledge
the Poseidon at the begging of the manual, so I felt it would be ok
to remove all that cruft.

Manually removing that Postscript commands were pretty annoying. So I
created this script. It's written in Python, plain and easy. And does
works. To run it, you have to give two arguments: the input file (the
one generated by Poseidon) and the output file:

	remove_poseidon_stuff class_diagram.eps class_diagram_new.eps

The script works fine with the diagrams I generated, but I do not
believe it will survive newer (or older) versions of Poseidon. Feel free
to improve the script as required. Just be sure to run the test cases,
described at 'testcases' directory, and check if the conversion works ok.

If you have to create new regular expressions, you may use the Kodos [3]
application (a regex tester). Pretty amazing application, and it generates
Python code! You may look at the 're' directory, there are some files for
the regex currently used by the 'remove_poseidon_stuff' script.
